### PeopleNet: Front-end   Software   Engineer   Interview   Exercise

* Follow   the   directions   below   to   build   a   single   page   web   app
* Create   a    README.md    that   explains   how   to   run   the   project
* Check   all   of   the   above   into   a   new   public   repository   in   GitHub
* Email   the   repo   link   to   your   HR   contact!

## Problem
At PeopleNet   we're   all   about   the   transportation   industry.   For   this   exercise   we   would   like to   help   route   a   truck   from   point   A   to   point   B   on   a   fictional   "map".

Your   web   page   should   allow   the   user   to   input   a   text   based   maze.   The   app   should   solve this   maze   and   find   the   shortest   route   from   the   start   to   the   finish.    Hereâ€™s   a   hint,   take   a look   at   Breadth-first   search   (BFS).

Provide   visualizations   of   the   maze   itself,   and   the   final   solution,   including   an   output   of   the number   of   steps   it   took   to   solve   that   particular   maze.   Don't   be   afraid   to   be   creative   with the   visualizations.

The   project   should   include   all   the   necessary   build   tasks   to   run   locally,   so   that   we   can   try it   out.
A   valid   maze   may   contain   the   following   types   of   characters:
* _._    represents   an   open   road
* _#_    represents   a   blocked   road
* _A_    represents   the   starting   point
* _B_    represents   the   destination   point

Anything   outside   the   bounds   of   the   array   should   be   considered   a   wall.   In   addition,   you may   only   move   in   horizontal   or   vertical   directions.   Diagonal   movements   are   not   allowed.

Example   input   maze:
```
##########
#A...#...#
#.#.##.#.#
#.#.##.#.#
#.#....#B#
#.#.##.#.#
#....#...#
##########
```

Example   simplified   visual   of   the   solution,   using    @    to   represent   the   correct   path.   The shortest   number   of   steps   in   this   case   is   14.   An   ASCII   representation   like   this   is   not recommended   however   for   the   final   solution.
```
##########
#A@@.#...#
#.#@##.#.#
#.#@##.#.#
#.#@@@@#B#
#.#.##@#@#
#....#@@@#
##########
```

**Goal**
Your   solution   should   be   able   to   solve   the   included   mazes    maze1.txt    (pictured   above), maze2.txt ,   and    maze3.txt    correctly.   Each   maze   solution   should   run   in   under   a   minute   on reasonable   hardware.
